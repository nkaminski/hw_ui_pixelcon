=== Hardware-based UI Arduino Pixel Controller ===


hw_ui_pixelcontroller is a simple pixel controller application for Arduino with 
a strictly "hardware based" user interface, in the sense that the behavior 
of the attached pixel string can be controlled via the presence or absence
of at most 3 M-M jumper wires with no additional components needed. This is
convenient when you wish to modify the behavior on a semi-regular basis
but don't have access to a suitable computer at such location for example.

Usage: Details of the configuration and behavior are documented at the top of the
main source code file. 

This should work on any board supported by the FastLED (http://fastled.io/)
libraries, but has only been tested on an Arduino Mega 2560.
